## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Hook the form up so it sends and stores the user's enquiry (you can use a spreadsheet or Airtable to save the enquiries)
- **Bonus**: Add your own details (image, skills, projects) to replace the ones in the design

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript


### What I learned

**So...** This is the first project which I am customizing to my own use. I spent some time getting it responsive as per the design. Everytime I learn that I should spend more time planning, because many things appear lately during development that causes things to be re-done.

I guess the main points here are:

- I used CSS filter for the first time.
- I wired the form to a node api which in turn sends the entries to a database and also by email.

### Continued development

**Features to add:**
- Replace the dummy projects to my actual projects.
- Load the projects from a JSON file instead of hardcoding them.
- ~~work on data validation in the form with error handling~~ and probably adding a capcha.

**Maybe**
- Add a blog section
- Add testimonials section



### Useful resources

- [CSS grid generator](https://cssgrid-generator.netlify.app/) - CSS grid generator is always the go to tool when it comes to making a grid.
- [CSS filter generator](https://angel-rs.github.io/css-color-filter-generator/) - This tool was helpful to generator the filter that color's the white icons on hover.
